		<h1>Happening</h1>
		<p class="lead">Happening is an event-production company that puts together concerts, parties, shows, and more. They are focused on promoting both their events and their services as second-to-none for a wide variety of brands and clients. Their image is energetic, youthful, and fun.</p>
		<h2>The Scene Design Systems</h2>
		<p>Happening strives to host and plan THE event and stand apart from the rest. “The scene” is synonymous with the chicest and most sought after events. It’s trendsetting. Being on the scene implies the person experienced something first. Everyone wants to be on THE scene. Naming a design system in this way not only paints a picture of the kind of events this company produces, but also directly relates to what is being shown. This is the scene of our brand.</p>
		<h2>Identifiers</h2>
		<p>Bright, playful, contemporary, lustrous, vivacious</p>
